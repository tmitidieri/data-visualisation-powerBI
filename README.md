# Data Analysis Training
This repository contains the task that I completed during the Data Analysis Trainee program at Generation.
The training is structured with theoretical lessons and hands-on assignments. These assignments include projects designed to allow us practice our Excel, SQL, Python and Data Visualisation skills.

## Project Overview
Olist Store is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without the hassle and with a single contract. The Brazilian eCommerce public dataset of orders (from 2016 to 2018) made at Olist Store has been provided to your company for analysis.
My team was asked to analyse the provided dataset using my data analytics skills, prepare a PowerBI dashboard with visualisations that answer critical questions and prepare and present a final report.

## Goals
1. Visualise a companyâ€™s customer demographics, sales trends, orders by categories, orders changes by year, etc.
2. Utilise created visualisations to provide recommendations for improvements
3. Create a final report.
4. Deliver a group presentation, clearly communicating analytical results

## Data Collection
Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces, generously provided this dataset. After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store, a seller is notified to fulfil that order. Once the customer receives the product or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note about the purchase experience and write down some comments.

## My contribution
I was responsible for the preliminar analyse of the datasets, to identify which datasets would be useful for our exploration. After the exploratory stage, I focused on implementing analysis to find trends and patterns of customer's behaviour. I created the design theme for the charts and dashboard and lead the presentation for the live audience with a variety of stakeholders, such as mentors, colleagues and the trainee program director. I manage the project' timeline with daily check-ins and communication using Slack.


## Requirements
All the tasks were completed using Excel and Power BI. No additional packages or libraries were used.
